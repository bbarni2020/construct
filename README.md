# Framework

Continuation of last week's project: https://github.com/ArcaEge/rocket

A template site for a mysterious Hack Club YSWS event, I'll be reusing the same site design but with different content.

<!-- The site is available at: https://traffic.arcaege.dev/ -->

Built with SvelteKit, deployed with Docker (auto-builds container and publishes to GitHub packages!)

## Developing

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the stuff inside. When testing locally, Slack will redirect you to a HTTPS localhost URL and you'll need to change it to HTTP (this is because Slack doesn't allow setting the redirect URL to a HTTP URL).

Instructions generated by Svelte project generator:

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```
